# Ultimate Tokens by NONOUN

**▶ [Try it live](https://kimgranlund.github.io/nonoun-color-tokens/)** — the dependency-free,
single-file build, served straight from GitHub Pages. (It's the very same `.html` you get from a
local build; download it and it runs offline from `file://`.)

A perceptual color-palette and **design-token** generator. It builds tonal ramps that are visually
even across their whole range, derives a **59-role semantic layer** (surfaces, on-colors, outlines,
containers, scrims, inverse), and exports to **CSS, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Figma, DTCG, JSON** and
more — plus a one-click `.zip` of everything.

It ships three ways: a **Vite web app**, a single dependency-free **`<nonoun-color-tokens>` web
component**, and a **Figma plugin** that writes the palette straight into the file's variable
collections.

<!-- Hero: regenerate with `npm run gen:preview` — rendered straight from the engine (projectView) in the PERCEPTUAL distribution. -->
![The 8 default palettes — perceptual tonal ramps, 050 → 950](.claude/docs/img/palette-preview.svg)

> The image above is the tool's **real output** — the eight default palettes in the **perceptual**
> distribution, rendered straight from the engine (no mockup): perceptually-even steps, in-gamut deep
> ends, and `Warning`'s deliberately lifted light end. Regenerate any time with `npm run gen:preview`.

## What it does

- **Perceptual ramps.** Color is modeled in **HCT / CAM16** and **OKHSL**. Each palette is a tonal
  ramp (050 → 950) with three **distribution modes** — `even` (uniform CIELAB L\*), `perceptual`
  (uniform OKHSL lightness + gamut-proportional chroma, the **default**), and `peak` (anchored to the
  hue's chroma cusp). A **vibrancy** control keeps the palette's mid vivid, `relative-chroma`
  harmonizes saturation across hues, and a chroma floor kills the near-white dead zone.
- **Key colors.** Pin exact brand colors (a `dominant` and optional `supportive`, stored losslessly in
  OKLCH); the ramp is re-derived around them through the perceptual lens, so a palette keeps its real
  source color while every other stop stays even.
- **Compose new palettes.** Derive a new palette from the ones you already have — a **Relative**
  color-theory relationship (extend / complement / contrast / bridge / anchor / recontextualize, pivoting
  on your primary), an **Environmental** neutral (the set's chroma-weighted-mean hue at a restrained
  chroma), or a **Custom** pick (a native color picker, or hue + chroma) — with a hue × chroma plot and a
  live ramp preview before you commit. Drag palettes by their handle to reorder.
- **59-role semantic layer.** From each palette the engine derives the full role set — accents,
  on-colors, surfaces (dim/bright/low/high), outlines, containers, scrims, and inverse — resolved for
  **Light and Dark** in one pass.
- **Gallery + Color Categories.** Keep your own sets under **Your Palettes**, or browse **Color
  Categories** — a curated hub of **7 categories** (Architecture, Cuisine, Film, Literature, Music,
  Nature, Travel), each **12 volumes × 4 = 48** palettes (336 total), sourced from real places, dishes,
  films, biomes… and carrying their story. Open any one as an editable copy. Each category's data is
  lazy-loaded.
- **Exports.** CSS (Hex or **OKLCH**), **Tailwind v4**, **shadcn/ui**, **Figma** variables,
  **Figma UI3** (Material), **DTCG**, **JSON**, a re-importable parametric **Config**, and a
  **Download-all `.zip`**. An **Include** toggle row picks which token systems — **Color · Typography ·
  Geometry** — ride the Download-All `.zip` and the Brand-Kit MCP.
- **Typography.** The type analog of the color engine — a few params → a **systematic type scale** of
  seven voices (Display · Heading · Sub-heading · Kicker · Body · UI · Code), with derived size (modular scale), optical
  letter-spacing, leading, and weight. Pick a **treatment** (Product, Luxury, Editorial, Technical,
  Brutalist), preview a live specimen, export **CSS + DTCG** type tokens.
- **Geometry.** The spatial analog — a few params → a **systematic size ramp** (XS–2XL) → derived control
  geometry on one **centering law** (edge padding = (height − glyph) / 2; the pill radius, the icon-only
  square, and the slot paddings all fall out of it). Pick a **treatment** (Comfortable, Compact, Spacious,
  Touch, Pill), preview a live size ramp, export **CSS + DTCG** `dimension` tokens.
- **Brand-Kit MCP.** Download a **zero-dependency MCP server** pre-filled with your tokens — point
  **Claude Code / Cursor / any MCP agent** at it (`node brand-kit-server.mjs`) and it serves the
  **systems you opted in** (palettes, ramps + the 59-role semantic layer in light + dark; the typography
  scale; the geometry scale) so the agent builds with your exact tokens. See `mcp/`.
- **System / light / dark.** The app chrome and the canvas preview each follow the OS by default
  (sun · moon · system toggles); the chrome dogfoods the very tokens the tool generates.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server with HMR (http://localhost:5173)
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build      # gen assets → categories → tsc → vite build (dist/) → offline single-file → figma ui.html
npm run preview    # serve the built dist/
```

`npm run build` produces:
- `dist/` — the Vite-built web app (the color categories are code-split into lazy chunks).
- `dist/nonoun-color-tokens.html` — a dependency-free **offline single-file** build (open it
  directly). This is the artifact published to the [live demo](https://kimgranlund.github.io/nonoun-color-tokens/).
- `figma/plugin/ui.html` — the Figma plugin UI (the bundled app + a postMessage bridge).

## Test

```bash
npm test           # regenerates the build artifacts, then runs every verifier + the headless DOM boot
```

The test suite is the real coverage — pure-`node` verifiers per layer (engine round-trips, tonal-curve
fidelity, the OKHSL ↔ sRGB module, the 59-role table vs. the canonical answer key, the export formats,
the Figma raw→semantic cascade, persistence round-trip) plus a DOM-shim boot
(`test/ui/headless-boot.mjs`) that drives the real `app.js` — gallery, color categories, editor, exports —
without a browser.

## Layout

```
src/
  engine/   hct.js · okhsl.js · tonal.js · semantic.js · exports.js   — pure ES modules, no DOM
  ui/       app.js · model.mjs · persist.js · styles.css · icons.js · zip.mjs
            categories/     index.js + one lazy module per category (generated)
            figma-plugin-assets.js
  main.ts   — Vite entry (imports the stylesheet + <nonoun-color-tokens>, mounts it)
figma/
  plugin/   code.js · manifest.json · ui.html              — the generator AS a Figma plugin
  binder/   bind-plan.mjs · figma-semantic-binder/          — the standalone Semantic Binder plugin
scripts/    bundle.mjs · gen-categories.mjs · gen-figma-ui.mjs · gen-figma-assets.mjs · gen-preview.mjs
.claude/docs/spec/  the product specification, the canonical data/role-table.json (the answer key),
            and colors/categories/*.json (the color-category source data gen-categories reads)
test/       engine/ · ui/ · figma/ · run.mjs
```

The engine is pure and DOM-free; `src/ui/app.js` defines the `<nonoun-color-tokens>` web component over
it; the Figma plugin reuses the exact same bundle. `.claude/docs/spec/data/role-table.json` is the **canonical
contract** the semantic / export / figma verifiers validate against — it is the spec, not a derived
file. The Color Categories are generated from `.claude/docs/spec/colors/categories/*.json` by
`npm run gen:categories` (into `src/ui/categories/`).

## Figma plugin

Two plugins live under `figma/`:

- **`figma/plugin/`** — the generator itself, running inside Figma. In Figma: *Plugins → Development →
  Import plugin from manifest…* and pick `figma/plugin/manifest.json`. Its **Add Variables → Figma**
  action writes a **`Color Primitives`** collection (the raw colors) + a **`Color Modes`** collection
  (the semantic Light/Dark tokens, aliased to the primitives) and embeds the parametric config in the
  file (`root pluginData`) for a lossless round-trip.
- **`figma/binder/`** — the standalone **Semantic Binder** (`figma/binder/figma-semantic-binder/`),
  which aliases each semantic role to its raw variable so editing a raw color cascades live.
