# Adding (or changing) an export format — ultimate-tokens

An export format is one serializer that turns the resolved engine output into a portable artifact (a CSS
string, a DTCG tree, a framework file). The **color** formats live in `src/engine/exports.js` (8 of them,
and ONLY those 8 — see below); **type** + **geometry** formats live in `src/engine/type.mjs` and
`src/engine/geometry.mjs`. The non-obvious truth of this repo: almost every color emitter MAPS over each
palette's resolved `roles`, so a new semantic role emits a leaf **automatically** — you add a format, not
a per-role branch. The two things that bite are (1) ShadCN is the deliberate exception to that auto-flow,
and (2) a new serializer is invisible until it is wired into THREE places: `exportAll`, the model's
`view.exports`, and the drawer. Depth in `references/`. The per-format output shapes are owned by
`docs/reference/references/knowledge-04-export-formats.md` — cite it, don't re-derive it. The role-side
auto-flow is owned by `adding-semantic-roles` — cite it, don't duplicate.

**Not this skill's territory: `src/engine/ds-export.js`.** The Claude Design / Google Stitch / Figma Make
"DS bundle" DESIGN.md-authoring subsystem (`dsColorRoles`, `exportDesignSystemTokens/Spine/Components/
Receipt/Bundle/StitchBundle/MakeBundle`, the `dsMake*Md` prose generators) used to share a file with the 8
color formats above — split out in TKT-0015 because it's a different KIND of code (content/prose authoring
for a consumption bundle, not token serialization) and was undocumented drift risk for this skill's own
"8 formats" claim. It imports a handful of this file's helpers (`derivedAll`, `roleOklch`, `hexOf`, `hex8`,
`relLumExp`, plus the already-public `cssPrefixOf`/`dialogBackdropOklch`/`exportShadcn`) but is otherwise
independent, has no rubric of record in `docs/reference/` yet, and is out of scope here — don't route a
DS-bundle change through this skill's procedure, and don't add its formats to `exportAll` (it is bundled by
the UI directly, same as the type/geometry emitters).

## The format model (depth in `references/foundations.md`)

`derivePalette(palette, controls, overrides)` (exports.js) computes everything an emitter needs ONCE per
enabled palette — the slug, the solid stops, the scrims, and the resolved semantic roles (the exact return
tuple + the resolved-role shape: `references/foundations.md` §1). **There is NO resolver in the returned
object** — `resolveRef` is a local closure that runs at derivation time, so the roles arrive pre-resolved:
emitters read `r.light`/`r.dark` for a color and use `refKey(r.lightRef)` only for the raw var-NAME fragment,
never re-resolving a ref. `derivedAll(state)` maps it over `enabledPalettes` (the `on !== false` filter) in State
order — so **disabled palettes are absent from every format**, for free. Every color emitter starts
`const palettes = derivedAll(state)` and loops.

**The auto-flow vs the ShadCN exception.** `exportCSS / exportOKLCH / exportJSON / exportDTCG / exportUI3 /
exportTailwind` all iterate `p.roles` directly — a new role flows through with no edit. **`exportShadcn` does
NOT.** It iterates the fixed `SHADCN_ORDER` array (in `exports.js`) over a hand-curated suffix-lookup
`MAP` that pulls roles BY SUFFIX (`rs(neutral, "-surface")`, `prime(primary)` = the empty-suffix accent) and
picks the driver palette BY NAME REGEX — neutral-, primary-, and danger-family name matches, so it survives
renamed/preset palettes (the exact regexes: `references/foundations.md` §3). A new role appears in ShadCN
only if you wire it into `MAP` — and
that is a deliberate design choice (ShadCN has a FIXED token contract), not a gate. Don't "fix" it by spilling
all roles in.

**The shared naming rules** (don't reinvent): `pad3` (3-digit stop padding, ADR-006), `slug` (palette → token
namespace), the `--c-*` custom props where raw names end in DIGITS and semantic names end in a WORD so they
share the prefix without collision, `light-dark()` for the mode flip in the semantic layer (ADR-005), and
scrims keyed `500-{step}` at alpha% = step/10. `refKey` (from `semantic.js`) normalizes a ref to its var-name
fragment — emitters use it to build a NAME, never to re-resolve a ref to a color.

## Procedure — add a serializer, then wire its three surfaces

1. **Write the serializer in the right file.** A COLOR format → `export function exportX(state)` in
   `exports.js`; start `const palettes = derivedAll(state)` and loop `p.stops` / `p.scrims` / `p.roles`. Reuse
   `hexOf` / `oklchStr` / `roleOklch` / `colorLeaf` / `pad3` / `refKey` — never hand-format a color, never
   re-resolve a ref. A TYPE format → `typeTokensX(scale)` in `type.mjs` (operate on a resolved
   `typeScale(config)`); a GEOMETRY format → `geomTokensX(scale)` in `geometry.mjs` (a resolved
   `geomScale(config, opts)`). DTCG outputs use the W3C `$type`/`$value` composite shape; `geomTokensFigma` is
   the one that emits UNITLESS `$type:"number"` (Figma float variables) — mirror its sibling, minus the `px`.
2. **Bundle it into `exportAll`** (exports.js, end) — color formats only; the type/geom emitters are bundled
   separately by the UI, not here.
3. **Surface it in the model** so the UI can read it: in `src/ui/model.mjs`, `projectView`'s `exports = {…}`
   block — add your key (JSON-shaped formats are `JSON.stringify(…, null, 2)`; CSS-shaped are raw
   strings). This is the object the drawer reads as `view.exports[id]`.
4. **Wire the drawer tab** (`renderDrawer`'s `FORMAT_GROUPS` in `src/ui/app.js`): add `[id, "Label"]` to the
   right group (groups are by DESTINATION — CSS · Frameworks · Design tools · Typography · Geometry ·
   Project). A type/geom format also needs an entry in `SYSTEM_CODE` (the lazy generator) + `SYSTEM_LABEL`; a
   color format is read straight from `view.exports[this.exportTab]` and needs neither.
5. **Add it to the Download-All zip** (`downloadAllZip` in `src/ui/app.js`): push `{ name: "folder/file.ext", data }`
   under the correct system toggle — `sys.color` / `sys.type` / `sys.geometry`. Colour formats ride
   `sys.color`; the `figma/` folder + the experimental `figma-aliased/` cascade (via `this.figmaBundle()`,
   OD-004) live there too. The re-importable config is pushed ALWAYS.
6. **Document the shape** in `docs/reference/references/knowledge-04-export-formats.md` — it is the owner of per-
   format output shapes; add a section (and keep the eight-formats header count consistent if you added a color
   format). For ShadCN/Figma constraint changes, respect the fenced ADR notes (ADR-002 resolved-vs-aliased,
   ADR-007 UI3 is interchange-only) — do not "fix" them.

## Validate (draft → check → fix → re-check)

Run the cheap pure verifier first — it is the fastest signal and gates the emitted SHAPE of every format:

```
node test/engine/exports.mjs    # well-formed DTCG leaves, on-color policy, padding, disabled-palette,
                                 # tailwind @theme + shadcn :root/.dark parity, every format non-empty
node test/engine/type.mjs       # typeTokensCSS/DTCG: fontFamily group + composite typography $type
node test/engine/geometry.mjs   # geomTokensDTCG (dimension) + geomTokensFigma (unitless number) shapes
npm test                        # all of the above + headless-boot (drawer/download) + shell + persist
```

The gate that catches a malformed color leaf is `leaf-valid` in `exports.mjs` (srgb, components in [0,1], hex
reconstructs from components). The gate that catches a format you forgot to bundle is `nonempty` — it loops a
fixed key list (`css/oklch/json/dtcg/ui3/tailwind/shadcn`) over `exportAll`, so a new color format absent from
either `exportAll` OR that key list is not actually checked — add it to BOTH. For a new FRAMEWORK format, add a
dedicated `[gate]` group asserting its load-bearing structure (mirror the `tailwind` / `shadcn` gate groups:
`@theme {` present, `oklch(` values, `:root`/`.dark` token-set parity, disabled palette absent). Don't call it
done until `npm test` is green AND the format renders in the drawer + lands in the Download-All zip.
