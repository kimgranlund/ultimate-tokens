  Spec cell for the HCT Palette Generator — a single-file browser tool that builds
  perceptually even color palettes (hue and chroma from CAM16, tone from CIELAB L-star,
  clamped to the sRGB gamut ceiling by construction) plus a 53-role semantic token layer,
  exporting to CSS, OKLCH, JSON, Figma DTCG, and a Figma cascade plugin. Scope: the tool and
  its parts — the color engine (CAM16, gamut search, fixed viewing conditions),
  tonal-scale generation (curves, skew, lift, chroma damping), the semantic token system
  (roles, on-colors, scrims, surface ramps, light/dark modes), the export formats and Figma
  import behavior, and the cascade plugin. NOT brand-color picking, NOT a build pipeline.
  Use whenever writing, enhancing, scoring, regenerating, debugging, or reviewing the tool or
  its spec, or when an agent needs the canonical role table, defaults, decision records, or
  acceptance criteria. Reach for it even if the request just says the palette tool, the HCT
  generator, scrims, on-colors, or the binder plugin.

# HCT Palette Generator — a perceptual, in-gamut palette + semantic-token generator

> **SKILL-format spec cell `spec.system.hct-palette-generator-spec`.** This file is both the
> readable brief and — in the fenced `json` contract block below — the machine-readable
> contract the **spec-quality** gate reads (the first `json` block is the single source of
> truth). Depth lives in `references/` and `rubrics/`; provenance and research-grounding in
> `CHANGELOG.md`. It carries everything needed to write, enhance, regenerate, or review the
> tool, and is structured for handoff to **spec-author** and downstream decomposition.

**Intent.** Design-system engineers need color ramps with *perceptually even* steps and a
full semantic token layer that survives a light/dark mode flip and imports without error into
CSS and Figma. Naive lightness scaling drifts hue and clips the gamut; a fixed per-hue chroma
clips at the light/dark ends; mode handling bolted onto raw colors breaks the moment a role
mapping stops being a simple mirror. The HCT Palette Generator removes all three at the root
by **treating color as a point in a perceptual space against a gamut boundary, not a scalar
to push around**: tone is CIELAB L\*, hue/chroma is CAM16, every emitted color is clamped
in-gamut at its tone, and the entire light/dark flip lives in one semantic `--c-*` layer over
flat raw tokens. Output is a set of portable token artifacts (five export formats) plus an
optional live raw→semantic cascade in Figma — delivered as one offline, dependency-free,
single-file tool.

> **"Perceptually even" = the ramp follows the selected CIELAB-L\* curve with stable hue
> (criterion `hpg-tonal-curve-fidelity`), NOT uniform ΔL\* steps — the logistic default is
> deliberately shaped. It governs ramp *spacing*, not contrast.** The on-colors are
> deliberately *not* contrast-optimized (ADR-003); do not read "perceptual" as a contrast
> guarantee. **"Imports without error"** is the DTCG resolved-color path (ADR-002) plus the
> plugin cascade — not an open-ended claim about every Figma version (ADR-002 is
> time-sensitive; re-verify on an enhancing pass).

**Acceptance criteria.** Twenty-seven checkable predicates, one contract criterion per
load-bearing predicate in `rubrics/acceptance-criteria.md` (AC-E/T/S/X/P/U) and
`rubrics/parity-checklist.md` (P1–P8) — promoted into the contract so the gate's signal
covers the *anti-hack* predicates (engine-math parity P6/P7, the chroma floor AC-T5, the
mirror invariant AC-S5, leaf validity AC-X5, the disabled-palette filter AC-U2), not only the
happy path. The machine-readable form is the contract block below; the full runnable
procedures (including the three-implementation extraction for parity) are in those rubric
files; engine anchors are `data/verification-anchors.json`.

**Non-goals.** Eight explicit boundaries (contract block), each tied to an ADR or OPEN
decision: not a brand picker / non-HCT tool (ADR-001; the 8-palette set is the current
default with expansion OPEN in OD-005); not a build-time pipeline (ADR-010); no contrast-aware
on-color auto-pick (ADR-003 / OD-001); no exposed VC controls (ADR-009); no *color-accurate*
OKLCH input (the bridge's drift is unbounded by design, ADR-008 — only its determinism is
validated); no plugin-free aliased export in this revision (resolved colors only, ADR-002;
the question is OPEN in OD-004); UI3 is interchange-only, not a native Figma import path
(ADR-007 / OD-003); no WCAG gating or a11y reporting (a raw contrast readout only).

**Decomposition.** Carves along the four-layer architecture plus the plugin and the UI/
persistence shell into six `capability` cells, each gated by a sibling `rubric` cell. Parity
is **split across three cells** (engine-math parity → `color-engine`; role-table parity →
`semantic-mapping`; plugin bindings/offline → `figma-plugin`) so no single child can launder a
shared `role-table.json` into a green "three implementations agree" while the engine math
diverges. `_entailment_check.py` proves the carving **covers** all criteria (the partial-order
gate: **29/29 covered, 6 tickets** — the count grew from 27 when `hpg-tonal-damping-curve` and
`hpg-tonal-edge-hue` were folded into the tonal ticket); the council's entailment lens additionally
pressure-tested intent-entailment. Full carving + the honest-maturity note in `references/decomposition.md`.
The six child rubric cells **and** the six capability cells are now **validated**. Two further
**integration** cells consume them downstream and are validated against their own harnesses — NOT part
of this engine/output carving (the same way the editor UI is a separate concern): `capability.system.ui-app`
(the interactive generator UI) and `capability.system.figma-plugin-app` (that same UI packaged as a Figma
plugin, applying `figmaBundle()` → a `Color Primitives` collection + a `Color Modes` Light/Dark collection whose
every role is aliased to its primitive, **idempotently** on re-apply).

1. **The engine is load-bearing and the spec is downstream of it.** Tone (CIELAB L\*),
   hue/chroma (CAM16), and the gamut ceiling are the irreducible mechanics. Get
   `knowledge-01` right and everything else follows; get it wrong and no amount of prose
   helps. Verify against `data/verification-anchors.json` before trusting any engine claim.

2. **Intent is captured as types and formulas, not adjectives.** `data/role-table.json` is
   the contract for the semantic layer; the knowledge docs give literal matrices and curve
   equations. When enhancing, route detail into the data file and the typed interfaces, not
   into more sentences. Most acceptance criteria above are executable `check`s; a few
   (engine parity, the chroma floor) are deliberately **differential/metamorphic** rather
   than fixed-point, because a fixed-point check over a small anchor set is gameable.

3. **Fenced choices are constraints, not bugs.** Several decisions are deliberately
   counter-intuitive (on-colors fixed to the 50/200 stops despite failing contrast on yellow;
   all scrims resolve onto a single 500 translucency ramp at alpha% = step/10 — so the scrim
   roles AND outline/container are mode-flat, light === dark; semantic exports are resolved not
   aliased). Each
   has an ADR and a matching **non-goal**, so the gate holds the boundary. Do not "fix" them
   by inference — that is the most common way this spec gets damaged.

4. **One source of truth.** Build the engine + the 53-role table ONCE (a module set imported
   everywhere) and drift is structurally impossible — that is the reference build, and parity is
   then automatic, not a gate. The 3-implementation framing (tool / `gen.js` / plugin) is *legacy
   packaging*: only when the same engine/table is reproduced across ≥2 independent implementations
   does parity become a real acceptance gate — `hpg-engine-parity` (differential, conditional) +
   `hpg-parity-roletable` (conditional) verify it then, via `rubrics/parity-checklist.md` (P1–P8).
   The plugin's own surface (`hpg-plugin-bindings`) is checked regardless. Parity is a property of
   multi-impl *distribution*, never of the domain.

## Working with this package

**If you are spec-author / a reviewer:**
1. The contract block above is the spec; `references/spec-draft.md` is the full Brief+TDD the
   contract summarizes (the hybrid header block, "How to Read", common spine, 📐💡⚠️ markers).
2. Use `references/knowledge-01..06`, `references/decision-records.md`, and
   `references/glossary.md` as the **grounded knowledge foundation** — they are primary
   sources; web research supplements only where they are silent (e.g. confirming current
   Figma import behavior, ADR-002, which is time-sensitive — re-verify on an enhancing pass).
3. Carry the ADRs and open decisions forward verbatim. ODs are first-class; ADRs are settled.
4. Score the spec with `rubrics/quality-rubric.md` (Layer A = 10 dimensions; Layer B =
   project completeness gate). Verify the *tool* against `rubrics/acceptance-criteria.md` and
   `rubrics/parity-checklist.md`. The mechanical floor is `spec-quality-check.py` on this
   folder; the judgment lenses are the `spec-council`.

**If you are regenerating or extending the tool:**
1. Read `references/decision-records.md` first — it tells you what *not* to change.
2. Build from `data/role-table.json` (canonical) outward; keep the three implementations in
   parity (`rubrics/parity-checklist.md`).
3. Validate every change against `rubrics/acceptance-criteria.md`.

## Opinionated defaults

- When enhancing, **keep the hybrid Brief+TDD shape** of `spec-draft.md` (it serves the
  maintainer and an implementing agent at once). Do not flatten it to a pure requirements list.
- When a number or formula is involved, **put it in a code block or a table**, never in prose
  — the spec is consumed by agents that generate from it.
- When a new decision is made, **add an ADR**; when a question is unresolved, **add an OD** —
  never bury either in narrative. A new acceptance property → a new contract criterion, not a
  sentence.

## When NOT to use this

- For generic color-theory questions unrelated to this tool — use a color skill instead.
- To pick brand colors or build a non-HCT palette — out of scope (see non-goals).
- For general spec writing unrelated to the HCT Palette Generator — use spec-author directly.
