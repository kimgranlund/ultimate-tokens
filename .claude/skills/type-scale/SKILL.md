# The typography engine — the type scale (nonoun-color-tokens)

One file, `src/engine/type.mjs`, the type analog of the color engine: a few per-voice params → a systematic
scale → DTCG / CSS tokens. Pure, no DOM, no magic numbers — every step's size, line-height, letter-spacing,
weight, and case is **derived** from the treatment's knobs. The conceptual *why* (the seven groups, the
system relationships, the leading bands, the target token shape) is owned by
`.claude/docs/spec/typography/README.md` — **cite it, don't re-derive.** Color lives next door in `color-math`;
this skill never touches color.

## The shape — five layers (depth in `references/foundations.md`)

| Layer | What it is | The contract |
|---|---|---|
| **`cat(role, base, ratio, leading, weight, trackingEm, steps, transform)`** | builds ONE voice's param record | `{role, base, ratio, leading, weight, trackingEm, steps, transform}` — no resolved sizes yet; `steps` defaults `STEPS_5`, `transform` `"none"` |
| **`make7(o={})`** | the FACTORY — returns the SEVEN named voices, sharing structure, reading per-voice knobs from `o` | `Display · Heading · Kicker · Eyebrow · Body · UI · Code` |
| **`TYPE_TREATMENTS`** (5) | each = `{id,label,note,fonts,categories:make7({...})}` | ids `product · luxury · editorial · technical · statement` (`statement` = Brutalist) |
| **`typeScale(config={treatment,bodyBase,overrides?,voices?,fonts?})`** | resolves a treatment → `{treatment,label,fonts,roleOf,categories}` | `roleOf` maps each voice→font role; `categories[voice][step]` = the resolved step. The three optional channels are **per-kit overrides** layered over the treatment, each **identity-gated** (absent/empty/non-finite ⇒ byte-identical output): `overrides` = flat per-cell `"<voice>\|<step>"`→size map (moves SIZE only); `voices` = `{<voice>:{weight,tracking,leading,ratio}}` reshaping a whole voice; `fonts` = `{<role>:family}` per-role font swap |
| **`typeTokensCSS` / `typeTokensResponsiveCSS` / `typeTokensDTCG` / `typeTokensFigmaModes`** | the emitters (operate on a resolved `scale`; px/rem/em via `dimUnit`) | CSS custom props + a utility class per step (+ per-breakpoint `@media` blocks) · DTCG composite `typography` tokens · a breakpoint-moded Figma collection |

## The taxonomy + the math — owned by `references/foundations.md`

One-line pointers; this body does not restate them:

- **Voice taxonomy** — the seven voices × two step ramps (`STEPS_5` 5 / `STEPS_UI` 8; 41 steps), the `roleOf` mapping (Eyebrow + Code → `mono`), the caps voices, the per-treatment case rules → foundations §2 + §4.
- **The math** — `buildCategory(name, p, factor, overrides, vp)` in type.mjs: modular scale → 8px floor → the nice-number ladder (with the monotonic bump) → per-cell/per-voice overrides; tracking stays OPTICAL on the modular size; `bodyBase` is the ONE global resize lever (`factor = bodyBase / Body.base` in `typeScale`) → foundations §3.
- **Emitter shapes** — the four emitters + the `dimUnit` px/rem/em option → foundations §6.
- **Leading bands** (display 1.05–1.2 · heading 1.05–1.3 · prose 1.45–1.65 · UI 1.25–1.5 · mono ~1.5) — stay inside them → foundations §3.

## The font-quoting guard — the Safari trap

`typeTokensCSS` emits `--font-{role}: '{family}';` — **the single quotes are load-bearing.**
A family name with a digit (`Source Serif 4`, `Inter Tight`) is invalid *unquoted* in a strict CSS parser:
**Safari drops the whole declaration and falls back.** The `luxury` treatment uses `Source Serif 4`, so the
verifier pins `typeTokensCSS(typeScale({treatment:"luxury"}))` contains `--font-display: 'Source Serif 4'`
(the luxury quoting assert in `test/engine/type.mjs`). Never emit an unquoted family. (This is the type echo of color's anchors — a
quiet break that *looks* fine in Chrome; see the smoke-is-Chrome-only memory.)

## The self-hosted fonts (the offline / Figma-plugin path)

The 4 families — **Inter, Inter Tight, Source Serif 4, JetBrains Mono** — are base64 woff2 `@font-face`
inlined in `src/ui/type-fonts.js` (one export, `TYPE_FONTS_CSS`), so the specimen renders in the real faces
offline AND inside the Figma plugin (`manifest networkAccess:"none"` hard-blocks the Google Fonts CDN).
`ensureTypeFonts()` (in `src/ui/app.js`) injects the `<style>` once AND eagerly registers all four via the
`FontFace` API + `load()` (the `<style>` path is lazy — Chromium activates a face only on first use, so a font
outside the current treatment flashes the fallback without the eager load).

- **`src/ui/type-fonts.js` is a COMMITTED generated asset** (header: "DO NOT EDIT"). **Do NOT hand-edit it.** Regenerate with `npm run gen:type-fonts` (= `node scripts/gen-type-fonts.mjs`).
- **`gen:type-fonts` is MANUAL — it is NOT in the build or test chain** (`package.json`: `build`/`test` do not call it). Run it ONLY when the font set changes, then commit the regenerated file. If you add/swap a family in `TYPE_TREATMENTS.fonts`, also add it to the `FAMILIES` array in `scripts/gen-type-fonts.mjs` (name + variable `wght` axis) and regenerate — otherwise the new face has no embedded woff2 and renders in the fallback.

## Procedure — change → check → fix → re-check

1. **Locate the layer — one frame each:**
   - A wrong size/leading/tracking/weight/case on a voice → a `make7` knob (default in `make7`, override in the treatment's `make7({...})`).
   - A new treatment → push a `{id,label,note,fonts,categories:make7({...})}` row onto `TYPE_TREATMENTS`.
   - A new voice group → add a `cat(...)` line in `make7` (its role flows into `roleOf` from `cat`'s first arg).
   - A bad emitted token → the emitter (`typeTokensCSS` / `typeTokensResponsiveCSS` / `typeTokensDTCG` / `typeTokensFigmaModes`).
   - A wrong/missing rendered face → `src/ui/type-fonts.js` (regenerate) + the treatment's `fonts`.
   - A **per-kit, user-tuned** size/shaping/font (NOT a treatment-wide change) → the `typeScale` override channels, never the treatment: a single cell → `config.overrides`; a whole voice's weight/tracking/leading/ratio → `config.voices`; a per-role font swap → `config.fonts` (each MUST stay identity-gated — see the `typeScale` row).
2. **Edit only `type.mjs`** (+ `scripts/gen-type-fonts.mjs` for a font change). Keep the math in `buildCategory` — never bake a resolved px size into a treatment; pass a `base`/`ratio`/`trackingEm` knob and let the engine derive it. Case is a per-treatment decision via the `transform` arg, not a blanket rule.
3. **Respect the invariants** (the tests assert these): Body MD = `bodyBase`; every size sits on the nice-number ladder and strictly increases XS→XL; Display tracks negative + scales with size; Context/Eyebrow uppercase + positive tracking; Eyebrow + Code map to `mono`; Code/UI carry the 8-step `STEPS_UI` ramp; exactly ONE treatment (Brutalist/`statement`) sets an uppercase Display; CSS families stay QUOTED; leadings inside the bands.
4. **New treatment? — add the SEVEN groups by passing the full `fonts` palette** (`display/heading/body/ui/mono` — five roles) so `roleOf` resolves every voice, and supply `note` (the UI specimen copy reads it). The test asserts every treatment has all seven groups + `fonts`.
5. **New font? — wire BOTH ends.** `TYPE_TREATMENTS.fonts` (so a voice uses it) AND `scripts/gen-type-fonts.mjs#FAMILIES` (so it's embedded), then `npm run gen:type-fonts` and commit `src/ui/type-fonts.js`.

## Validate (the anchor-style gate — draft → check → fix → re-check)

Run the pure verifier first (prints `type PASS` / `type FAIL (n)`; exit 1 fails), then the suite:

```
node test/engine/type.mjs    # 5 treatments × 7 groups · roleOf (Eyebrow+Code→mono) · the caps voices ·
                             # exactly ONE uppercase Display (Brutalist) · Body MD=bodyBase · monotonic XS→XL ·
                             # the nice-number ladder · LG/MD≈ratio · lineHeight=size·leading · optical tracking
                             # (Display neg / UI pos) · Code 8-step ramp · bodyBase scales uniformly ·
                             # the override channels (identity gates) · unknown→first · CSS class + px/rem/em ·
                             # the QUOTING guard (luxury → --font-display: 'Source Serif 4') · DTCG composite ·
                             # responsive @media · Figma modes
npm test                     # the above + ui/figma/exports + smoke gen (node test/run.mjs)
```

The guard that catches the Safari font break is the `typeTokensCSS(luxury)` quoting assert in `test/engine/type.mjs`. The guard that catches a forced-caps Display is the "exactly ONE treatment" filter there. Don't call it done until `node test/engine/type.mjs` AND `npm test` are green. If you regenerated fonts, also confirm `src/ui/type-fonts.js` is committed and the specimen renders in the real faces (the smoke is Chrome-only — eyeball Safari for the font path).
