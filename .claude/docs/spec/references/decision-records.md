## ADR-001 — HCT (CAM16 H/C + CIELAB L\*) over OKLCH-only
- **Context.** OKLCH is the obvious modern choice and the user is fluent in it.
- **Decision.** Use HCT: hue/chroma from CAM16, tone from CIELAB L\*.
- **Rationale.** HCT holds hue and tone stable across a ramp while maximizing chroma within
  gamut at each tone, which yields perceptually even tonal scales for design-system ramps.
  OKLCH is the **default** *input hue space* (mapped to CAM16) and an *output format*; cam16
  stays selectable (ADR-011).
- **Consequences.** Heavier engine (full CAM16 forward+inverse). OKLCH input requires a hue
  bridge — now the chroma-aware inverse (ADR-011, superseding the sampled ADR-008).
- **Status.** DECIDED.

## ADR-002 — Semantic export ships RESOLVED colors, not aliasData
- **Context.** Ideal would be semantic tokens that alias raw cross-collection so edits
  cascade on import.
- **Decision.** Light/Dark semantic DTCG files contain resolved colors with no `aliasData`
  by default. A `rawColl` field opts into emitting `aliasData`.
- **Rationale.** Verified against Figma's "Modes for variables" docs: cross-collection
  `aliasData` needs library-key UUIDs Figma only mints on export; name-only aliasData
  **errors** on native import (observed "errors importing N tokens") rather than falling
  back. Resolved colors always import.
- **Consequences.** No cascade via JSON import; cascade is delegated to the plugin
  (ADR provides the binder). Resolved files are larger but reliable.
- **Status.** DECIDED (default kept).
- **Re-verified 2026-06-15** (Figma "Modes for variables" help doc). The `com.figma.aliasData`
  extension now documents a resolution **fallback hierarchy**: `targetVariableID` → `targetVariableName`
  within a set matching `targetVariableSetID` → `targetVariableName` within a set matching
  `targetVariableSetName`. So cross-collection aliasing by **name + collection-name** (not a
  library-key UUID) IS a documented path **when the target collection already exists in the file**.
  The original "needs library UUIDs / name-only errors" framing is therefore **softened** — but the
  decision stands: resolved colors remain the always-safe default (import with no preconditions),
  while the aliased path is conditional on the Color Primitives collection pre-existing. Pure name-only
  (no `targetVariableSetName`) behavior remains undocumented. Feeds OD-004.
- **Spike 2026-06-17.** The `rawColl` opt-in already emitted the full name+collection shape
  (`targetVariableName` + `targetVariableSetName`); the export verifier now **asserts both** on every
  aliased semantic leaf (`hpg-export-resolved` / AC-X6), so the shape can't silently regress. This is
  SHAPE conformance only — the native-import cascade is still unvalidated end-to-end (no Figma in CI)
  and unexposed in the UI. Default stays resolved; the plugin stays the reliable cascade. Advances
  OD-004 to a **gated spike, not a decision**.

## ADR-003 — On-colors fixed to `050` in both modes  **(OVERRIDE)**
- **Context.** `on{N}` sits on the prime fill. A contrast-optimized system picks white or
  black per fill per mode for contrast. (Note: "perceptually even" — this tool's headline —
  governs ramp *spacing*, not contrast; the two are deliberately distinct, see SKILL Intent.)
- **Decision.** `on{N}` → `050` (both modes), `on{N}Variant` → `200` (both modes), for all
  palettes. The previously implemented **contrast-aware auto-pick logic was removed**.
- **Rationale.** Explicit user/brand requirement: on-colors should be the light tint
  uniformly. The user was shown the contrast data and chose this deliberately.
- **Consequences.** White-on-`Warning` (yellow) ≈ 1.8:1, below WCAG 4.5:1; in dark mode
  several palettes lose contrast as fills lighten. This is **accepted by design**. Tracked
  as OD-001.
- **Status.** DECIDED — **do not reintroduce contrast-aware on-colors as the DEFAULT without explicit
  instruction.**
- **Opt-in added (2026-06-25, explicit instruction).** The default stays `fixed` (050/200 both modes,
  as above). A new `onColorMode` control adds an opt-in `"contrast"` mode that re-points `on{N}`
  (050↔950) and `on{N}Variant` (200↔800) to the end with the better WCAG contrast vs the accent fill
  (550 light / 450 dark), per mode. It's a resolution-layer adjustment (`applyOnColorContrast`,
  applied in `projectView` + `derivePalette`) — `semanticRoles` and the canonical role table are
  UNCHANGED, so the default contract holds. This satisfies OD-001 without overriding ADR-003's default.

## ADR-004 — Semantic scrim roles use base 750 only  **(SUPERSEDED — see the 500-ramp revision)**
> **SUPERSEDED (2026-06-17).** Scrims are now a single **500-based** ramp: a scrim is `500-{step}`
> = the 500 color at alpha% = step/10, and all 12 scrim-using roles (the 7 `scrim*` + outline +
> container/Low/High) resolve onto it, mode-flat (light === dark). Bases 250/750 are no longer
> used. The historical decision is kept below for provenance.
- **Context.** Raw scrims existed on three bases (250/500/750 × 7 alphas). A revision surfaced
  all three as semantic role families (`scrim250*/scrim500*/scrim750*`, 21 roles).
- **Decision.** Revert to 7 unqualified scrim roles (`scrimWeakest…scrimStrongest`) on base
  750. Bases 250 and 500 remain raw primitives only.
- **Rationale.** User clarified that 250/500/750 scrims belong as raw primitives; base 250 is
  a *light* tint overlay and 500 a saturated mid — different overlays, not weaker dark
  scrims — so they were judged not semantically needed.
- **Consequences.** 37 roles/palette (not 51). Tracked as OD-002 in case a use case for
  250/500 semantic scrims appears.
- **Status.** DECIDED.

## ADR-005 — Two-layer model: flat raw + semantic `light-dark()`
- **Context.** The original design made all raw tokens mode-mirror pairs (light+dark=1000),
  so semantics were plain `var()` aliases.
- **Decision.** Raw tokens are flat, mode-independent single values. The light/dark flip is
  expressed once, in the semantic layer, via `light-dark(var(light), var(dark))`.
- **Rationale.** The mirror assumption broke as soon as non-mirror role mappings were
  introduced (e.g. `Dim 650/700`). The flat+semantic split works for any mapping and maps
  cleanly onto Figma's raw(single-mode)/semantic(Light,Dark) collection structure.
- **Consequences.** Every semantic CSS var references two primitives. Mode-switching is
  entirely in the `--c-*` layer.
- **Status.** DECIDED.

## ADR-006 — 3-digit zero padding everywhere
- **Context.** Stops range 50–950; mixing `"50"` and `"050"` causes sort and lookup bugs.
- **Decision.** All stop references zero-pad to 3 digits (`pad3`/`refKey`) in CSS var names,
  CSS refs, JSON keys, DTCG names, and UI3 keys. Scrims keep `"{base}-{step}"` with padded base.
- **CSS var prefix convention (2026-06-17; revised 2026-06-24).** RAW primitives and SEMANTIC roles
  both use the `--c-` prefix: raw are `--c-{family}-{stop|500-step}` and semantic are
  `--c-{family}-{role}`. A raw name's suffix always ends in DIGITS and a semantic name's in a WORD, so
  they never collide despite the shared prefix. (Originally raw used `--c_` with an underscore to
  flag raw-vs-semantic; revised to drop the `_` for a cleaner, all-hyphen CSS namespace — the
  digit-vs-word suffix already disambiguates.) Semantic vars reference raw vars via `var(--c-…)`.
- **Rationale.** Stable lexical sort, exact name matching against the user's `Color Primitives`
  collection (which is padded), no ambiguity; the raw/semantic prefix split is self-documenting.
- **Status.** DECIDED.

## ADR-007 — UI3 "Collections" schema is interchange-only, not native  **(CAUTION)**
- **Context.** A `figma-ui3-variables.color.schema.v1` export was added with in-file aliases.
- **Decision.** Keep it as a convenience/interchange format; **do not** present it as a
  native Figma Variables import format.
- **Rationale.** The schema string returns zero hits in Figma's documentation; it is not a
  verified native import path. Importing it via the Variables modal will not resolve as a
  user might expect.
- **Status.** DECIDED. Tracked as OD-003.

## ADR-008 — OKLCH→CAM16 hue is a sampled mapping  **(SUPERSEDED — see ADR-011)**
- **Context.** Users may enter hues in OKLCH; the engine works in CAM16 hue.
- **Decision.** Map an OKLCH hue to CAM16 by sampling one fixed mid color
  (L=0.72, C=0.10) at that OKLCH hue and reading its CAM16 angle. Memoized.
- **Rationale.** CAM16 hue at a given OKLCH hue varies with L and C; an exact per-color
  mapping is not well-defined for a single "hue input". The fixed sample is a deliberate,
  reproducible compromise.
- **Consequences.** A few degrees of drift vs. an exact mapping. Acceptable for hue *input*;
  not used for output color math.
- **Status.** SUPERSEDED by ADR-011. The fixed mid-sample mapping (and its "few degrees of
  drift") is gone: `oklchToCam16Hue` is now a chroma-aware Newton inverse that lands the
  rendered identity color on the stored OKLCH hue to ~0.00°.

## ADR-009 — Fixed viewing conditions (no VC controls)
- **Context.** CAM16 is parameterized by adapting luminance, surround, background.
- **Decision.** Derive one fixed VC (`makeVC`: average surround, bg 50, mid-gray adapting
  luminance) at load. Do not expose VC controls.
- **Rationale.** Target is screen sRGB under average surround — one stable appearance
  context. Exposing VC would make exports non-portable and the chroma peaks unstable.
- **Status.** DECIDED.

## ADR-010 — Single-file, dependency-free, offline
- **Context.** The tool is a design utility that should run anywhere with no setup.
- **Decision.** One self-contained HTML file, vanilla JS, no build step, no runtime
  dependencies; the zip writer is hand-rolled (`makeZip`/`crc32`); persistence falls back
  `window.storage → localStorage → in-memory`.
- **Rationale.** Portability and longevity; the artifact must open and work years later with
  no toolchain.
- **Consequences.** No npm libraries; any new capability must be implemented inline.
- **Status.** DECIDED.
- **Re-framed 2026-06-15 (from the build).** "Single-file" is the **distribution** format, not an
  authoring constraint. The reference build authors **modular ES modules** (engine · tonal · semantic ·
  export · persist) and **bundles** them to one offline HTML (`ultimate-tokens.html`, ~111 KB,
  opens via `file://`). Authoring modular *and* distributing single-file are both satisfied — the
  "no build step" line means *no toolchain is required to run it*, not *the source must be one file*.

## ADR-011 — OKLCH-native hue model + chroma-aware OKLCH→CAM16 inverse  (supersedes ADR-008)
- **Context.** The per-palette `hue` was a CAM16 hue by default, and the OKLCH→CAM16 bridge
  was a fixed mid-sample mapping (ADR-008) that drifted a few degrees (worst ~15° at the
  blue/violet pole). The user is fluent in OKLCH; the drift made OKLCH-entered hues land off.
- **Decision.**
  1. **OKLCH-native.** The doc-level `hueSpace` default flips **cam16 → oklch** (`tonal.js`
     `DEFAULT_CONTROLS.hueSpace`; `persist.js` `DOMAINS.hueSpace.default`). The per-palette
     `hue` is an OKLCH hue by default. `cam16` stays selectable; legacy docs saved under
     cam16 carry `hueSpace:"cam16"` explicitly and keep rendering in cam16 (preserved).
  2. **Chroma-aware inverse.** `oklchToCam16Hue(h, chromaFrac=1)` becomes a Newton inverse of
     the render path: it finds the CAM16 hue whose color, *at `chromaFrac` of that hue's peak
     chroma*, renders at the target OKLCH hue. It is chroma-aware because the OKLCH↔CAM16 hue
     map shifts with chroma (the **Abney effect**) — a fixed or cusp-only anchor is wrong at
     the other end. `effHue(hue, hueSpace, chromaFrac=1)` passes `palette.chroma/100`.
  3. **High-res HCT→OKLCH.** New `hctToOklch(hue, chroma, tone) → [L, C, H°]` reuses the CAM16
     solve and converts the converged linear sRGB straight through OKLab — no 8-bit
     round-trip. `projectView` emits `keyOklch`; the key HEX is derived from it.
- **Rationale.** Anchoring the solve at the palette's own chroma makes the rendered identity
  color land on the stored OKLCH hue to ~0.00°. **Principle:** HEX is only ever derived for
  consumption; perceptual coords come from the model at full precision (never measured back
  off an 8-bit hex).
- **Consequences.** Producers emit OKLCH hues: `gen-categories` stores each preset's source
  OKLCH hue and bakes `hueSpace:"oklch"`; `seedFromKeyColor(oklch, hueSpace="oklch")` returns
  the input's OKLCH hue (or CAM16 for a legacy cam16 doc); `defaultDocument` converts the 8
  starter CAM16 hues to OKLCH on the fly via `camHueToOklch`. **`role-table.json` is
  UNCHANGED** — still the cam16 answer key; the parity gate is intact. `hctToRgb` is
  byte-identical (refactored to share `_hctToLinRGB`). Engine gate: `hct-oklch-inverse`
  (`test/engine/hct.mjs`).
- **Status.** DECIDED.

## ADR-012 — Ramp hue anchored in each path's RENDER space (per-path direct solve)  (complements ADR-011)
- **Context.** ADR-011 makes the palette `hue` an OKLCH hue and lands the *identity* color on it to
  ~0.00°. But a RAMP is exported in OKLCH while **authored in another space** — the perceptual/peak ramp
  in **OKHSL** (`okhslStops`), the "even" ramp in **HCT/CAM16** (`paletteStops`). "Constant hue" disagrees
  between the author space and OKLCH by a chroma- **and lightness**-dependent amount (the **Abney
  effect**). Anchoring the hue through one proxy point — `effHue → oklchToCam16Hue`, sampled at the hue's
  **peak tone** and a chroma fraction (`hueAnchorFrac`) — left the KEY stop (500) off the set OKLCH hue:
  ~6° on perceptual blues, up to ~9° on the even path under mid-tone amplification (`dampAmp`).
- **Decision.** Anchor the hue in the space each ramp **renders**, at the **KEY stop (500)'s ACTUAL
  chroma + lightness** — not a peak-tone proxy. Each path Newton-solves its own author-space hue so stop
  500 reads back at the set OKLCH hue:
  1. **Perceptual/peak** → `solveOkhslHue(targetOklchHue, s₅₀₀, l₅₀₀)` over `rgbToOklchHue∘okhslToRgb`
     (shipped #201/#202).
  2. **Even** → `solveCam16Hue(targetOklchHue, c₅₀₀, tone₅₀₀)` over `hctToOklch` (this change).
  `effHue`/`hueAnchorFrac` are RETAINED for the `hueSpace:"cam16"` passthrough, the even path's **gamut
  basis** (the `c₅₀₀` seed), and the OKHSL cusp seed.
- **Rationale.** The error is a space mismatch that varies with **both** chroma and lightness, so only a
  solve at the stop's real conditions cancels it; a single peak-tone anchor is right at one end and wrong
  at the other. Same discipline as ADR-011 (anchor the inverse at the palette's own chroma) — **anchor in
  the space the ramp renders, not a proxy.** Result: **~0.5° across the wheel, any damping, both paths**
  (from 6°/9°).
- **Consequences.** A few extra Newton iterations per palette (cheap — palettes are few, the loop is ≤16
  steps and converges in ~3). **`role-table.json` is UNCHANGED** — this is a render-layer calibration, not
  a role remap, so the parity gate holds. Only OKLCH-hue palettes shift; `hueSpace:"cam16"` docs render
  byte-identical (the passthrough branch). Gate: `oklch-hue-anchor` (`test/engine/tonal.mjs`) asserts stop
  500 exports within **1°** of the set hue across the wheel incl. blues, for **both** ramp paths, at
  `dampAmp` 0 and 66.
- **Status.** DECIDED.

## ADR-013 — Editorial type voices (7 → 11) + the box/flow decoupling
- **Context.** The type taxonomy shipped **seven** voices (Display · Heading · Sub-heading · Kicker ·
  Body · UI · Code) — a `make7()` factory, each voice a size ramp riding one of five font roles
  (display/heading/body/ui/mono). It lacked the everyday **editorial** roles: a standfirst/lede, a
  block/pull quote, a figure/media caption, and fine-print. Two constraints shaped the fix: the engine
  emitters are all generic (a new voice auto-flows from one `cat()` line), and `role` conflated three
  things — the **font**, the **paragraph flow** (single-line height + paragraph factor), and the character.
- **Decision.** Add **four editorial voices → `make11()`** (via intent-grill, 2 rounds):
  1. **Set + roles.** **Lead** (body role — a larger standfirst), **Quote** (**heading** role, so it
     inherits each treatment's display face — a serif pull-quote in the serif treatments, a grotesque in
     Brutalist), **Caption** and **Legal** (fine-print). All four ride **existing** font roles, so **no new
     font** is introduced.
  2. **Lean ramp.** Each new voice uses a 3-step **`STEPS_3`** (SM·MD·LG, MD = base), not the full XS–XL
     — editorial voices use one-or-two registers. Total steps 41 → **53**.
  3. **The `box`/flow decoupling (OVERRIDE of the old role⇒flow coupling).** A new per-voice **`box`**
     field separates presentation flow from font role. It DEFAULTS from the role (`ui`/`mono` ⇒ `box`), so
     the seven originals are **byte-identical**. **Caption + Legal ride the ui FONT but set `box:false`** —
     they are PROSE (reading leading ~1.5, paragraph factor 0.75×, **no single-line height**), not the
     control/box treatment the UI voice itself gets. `singleLineHeight` and the paragraph factor now key on
     `box`, not on `role === "ui"||"mono"`.
  4. **Treatment integration** — hybrid: fixed cross-treatment defaults + a few per-voice knobs
     (`leadWeight`, `quoteLead`, `legalWeight`, …), the Kicker/Code pattern; used sparingly (Luxury lightens
     Lead/Quote, Editorial tightens the Quote leading, Brutalist heavies the Quote).
- **Rationale.** A voice is a **function**, so the editorial roles are voices (semantic tokens
  `--type-quote-*` etc.), not Body levels. Riding existing roles keeps the blast bounded; the `box` flag is
  the minimal, correct model for "ui font, prose flow" and generalizes the old ui/mono⇒single-line rule.
- **Consequences.** Emitters (CSS/DTCG/Figma/MCP) auto-flowed. The lockstep edits: `persist.js` VOICES
  allowlist (else per-voice overrides drop on hydrate — the one silent landmine), the test count literals
  (`GROUPS` 11, headless 53 steps / 11 groups), `styles.css` `.ty-s0…10` series colours, and the
  `TYPE_SPECIMENS`/`SHORT` maps. **There is NO code-enforced type answer-key** (unlike colour's
  `role-table.json`): `typography.tokens.json` is a frozen reference snapshot, and the consumption plugin's
  `voice-parity.mjs` **auto-derives** the voice list from the live engine — so parity holds without a
  hand-kept table; the spec/README/marketing "seven"→"eleven" is doc drift, serviced in the same change.
- **Status.** DECIDED.

---

## ADR-014 — The `ultimate-tokens` rename orphans all Figma `pluginData` (no migration is possible)
- **Context.** The product renamed `nonoun-color-tokens` → `ultimate-tokens` across four namespaces: the
  custom element, the localStorage keys, the Figma plugin id, and the brand-kit MCP schema. Three of the
  four are migratable. The fourth is not.
- **Decision.** Rename the Figma plugin `id` anyway, accepting that every key it ever wrote is orphaned.
- **Why no migration exists.** `figma.root.setPluginData(key, value)` is namespaced **by the calling
  plugin's id**. A plugin can only read back the data *it* wrote under *its own* id. Once the id changes,
  the pre-rename keys are not merely differently-named — they are **unreachable**, from any code path, in
  any plugin. There is no cross-id read API. A "migration" would have to run under the OLD id, and the old
  plugin is what's being replaced. So `LEGACY_CONFIG_KEY` (the `"hct-config"` fallback that survived the
  *previous* rename, when the id happened not to change) is dead code and was removed.
- **What is gated instead.** `load-config` must degrade to a **clean empty config** when only pre-rename
  keys are present — never throw, never silently adopt a stale one (`test/figma/plugin.mjs`, `config` gate).
  The user's cost is re-running *apply* once on an old `.fig`; the config also travels in the exported
  bundle, so nothing is unrecoverable.
- **Contrast with localStorage.** The web app's keys ARE migratable — same origin, no namespacing — so
  `migrateStorageKeys()` chains `hct-palette-state-v1` ← `nonoun-color-tokens` ← `ultimate-tokens`,
  newest legacy wins, and never overwrites a present key. The asymmetry is the platform's, not a choice.
- **Consequences.** The `<nonoun-color-tokens>` element tag stays registered as a deprecated alias (and its
  CSS selectors keep matching), because there the compatibility *is* free. The separately-published **Color
  Tokens Semantic Binder** plugin keeps its own id (`color-tokens-semantic-binder`) for the same reason in
  reverse: renaming it would orphan *its* data and its Figma listing, and it gains nothing.
- **Status.** DECIDED.

---

## ADR-015 — The product is unattributed: no maker brand, no "by" line, no monogram
- **Context.** The product shipped as **"Ultimate Tokens by NONOUN"**: a maker brand with an "N" monogram
  (favicon, og:image, in-app wordmark mark), a `nonoun.io` support/docs/account surface, and a voice
  platform whose §1 derived the house grammar rule ("no nouns, just verbs") from the *etymology* of the
  maker's name.
- **Decision.** Retire the maker brand entirely. The product is **"Ultimate Tokens"** — every mention, no
  longer form, no attribution. Copy speaks as "we"; nothing signs the work.
- **What replaced the nonoun.io surface.** Nothing branded. Support is **GitHub Issues**, docs are the
  **repo README**, billing is **Lemon Squeezy's own customer portal**. Every replacement link RESOLVES
  today — the alternative was a domain nobody owns, shipping 404s behind a nicer name. The unbuilt
  hosted-MCP and magic-link URLs became explicit `<APP_DOMAIN>` / `<MCP_DOMAIN>` placeholders, so Phase B
  must acquire a domain as step zero rather than inherit one.
- **What survived the removal.** The *stance*, not the signature. "No nouns, just verbs" is load-bearing on
  its own and stayed; only its origin story went. The one-person-workshop posture likewise steers how copy
  is written — it just no longer names anyone. **A workshop that names itself is performing smallness; one
  that ships is demonstrating it.**
- **The mark.** The monogram could not be renamed away — it *was* the letterform. It was deleted, along
  with its eight `ico-nonoun-*` assets, and the favicon set was regenerated from a brand-neutral mark:
  four tonal swatches, which say what the product *is* rather than who made it.
- **Why this is gated, not swept.** A find-and-replace decays. The next person to write a toast, an og:
  tag, or a lifecycle email reintroduces the maker by muscle memory, and re-attribution is a *factual*
  claim about who makes this. So `test/repo/branding.mjs` runs in `npm test` and fails on `NONOUN`, on any
  `nonoun.io` URL, and on the pre-rename identifier outside a named back-compat allowlist. `voice-check.mjs`
  raises the same word to **ERROR** in copy.
- **What still, deliberately, names the old identifier.** The `<nonoun-color-tokens>` element tag and the
  `migrateStorageKeys()` prefix chain: back-compat machinery, not branding (see ADR-014). The allowlist in
  the gate is the boundary, and a *new* file may not quietly join it.
- **Status.** DECIDED.
