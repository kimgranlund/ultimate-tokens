// motion.mjs, the MOTION facet of a brand kit. Pure, no DOM (an engine module).
//
// Motion is the one facet whose values are not derived from the user's parameters (there is no motion
// engine, and no Settings picker): they are SYSTEM CONSTANTS with provenance. So this module's job is
// to carry them accurately, cite them, and let the exports state the LAWS an agent must follow, a
// DESIGN.md's Motion section is a rulebook, not a slider.
//
// ── Why Material-founded curves and not springs ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The estate's house default for motion is Apple-style springs (velocity continuity, mid-flight
// retargeting). Two rationales don't apply here, so we deviate deliberately (naming the reason, per
// the deviation doctrine):
//   1. Every target that consumes this kit renders on the WEB (Claude Code / Stitch / Figma Make →
//      React + Tailwind + shadcn). Web has no spring tokens; springs are realized by sampling
//      stiffness/damping into `linear()`. A cubic-bezier + ms ladder is directly bindable everywhere.
//   2. This kit's semantic role system is already Material-Design-founded; a Material-founded motion
//      layer keeps one lineage across color, geometry, and motion.
// A consuming project that IS spring-native (SwiftUI, Compose, M3 Expressive) should use its own
// spring set, the laws below (enter/exit asymmetry, compositor-only, reduced-motion) still hold.
//
// Provenance: values are the published M3 spec set, the material-foundation token repo's
// `css/motion.css`, MDC-Android Motion.md, m3.material.io (as carried by the
// `material-design-motion-tokens` pack, accessed 2026-07-09). The perception limits, enter/exit
// asymmetry, never-animate list, and reduced-motion policy come from the `motion-design` corpus
// (Nielsen's limits; web.dev asymmetric-animation-timing + animations-guide; WCAG 2.2.2/2.3.1/2.3.3;
// vestibular.org). Cited in DESIGN.md so a consuming agent can audit the claim.

// EASING, cubic-bezier control points. NOTE the published caveat: `emphasized` carries the SAME
// bezier as `standard`; the emphasized family's distinctness lives in its accelerate/decelerate
// variants. We reproduce that faithfully rather than inventing a distinct curve.
